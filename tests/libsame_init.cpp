// XXX: This is essentially impossible to test. libsame_init() does not contain
// any failure conditions, and its only use is to populate the sine wave lookup
// table when the LUT engine is used. This table is statically allocated and
// local to the library with no public exposure. This may change in the future,
// but for now it is pointless. This unit test is stubbed out accordingly.
